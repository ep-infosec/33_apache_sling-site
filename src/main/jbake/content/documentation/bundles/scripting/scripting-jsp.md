~~~~~~

The Apache Sling JSP Scripting Engine is implemented by the [`org.apache.sling.scripting.jsp`](https://github.com/apache/sling/tree/trunk/bundles/scripting/jsp)
 bundle, based on the Jasper 2 JSP engine.

On top of that Apache Sling also provides its own JSP Taglib, implemented by the
 [`org.apache.sling.scripting.jsp.taglib`](https://github.com/apache/sling/tree/trunk/bundles/scripting/jsp-taglib) bundle.

The Sling Scripting JSP Taglib supports the use of Sling as an application in JSP pages.  The Sling Taglib provides the
 ability to invoke JSP scripts, include Resources and interact with the Sling Repository, all with JSP tags and
 [Expression Language (EL)](http://docs.oracle.com/javaee/6/tutorial/doc/gjddd.html) functions.

## Use

Using the Sling Taglib in a JSP page is as simple as including the Taglib include in your JSP, with the correct URI for the
version of the Sling Taglib installed.

    <%@taglib prefix="sling" uri="http://sling.apache.org/taglibs/sling" %>

Generally, the prefix to use is `sling`.  Often applications include a global JSP file which includes the Sling Taglib
and sets up all of the application variables and methods.

The Sling Taglib does not attempt to reproduce the functionality of other Tag Libraries, such as
[JSTL](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/index-jsp-135995.html); additional Tag Libraries may be required to fully leverage
the Sling Taglib.

## Taglib Versions

There have been a number of releases of the Sling Taglibs, including versions with different URIs.

| Taglib Version | Bundle Version | URI |
|---|---|---|
| 1.0 | 2.0.6 | http://sling.apache.org/taglibs/sling/1.0 |
| 1.1 | 2.1.0 | http://sling.apache.org/taglibs/sling/1.1 |
| 1.2 | 2.1.8 | http://sling.apache.org/taglibs/sling/1.2 |
| 1.3 | 2.2.0 | http://sling.apache.org/taglibs/sling |

All releases from 1.3 onward are expected to use the URI `http://sling.apache.org/taglibs/sling` to ensure ease of
upgrading to newer versions of the Taglib.

* **slingRequest**, SlingHttpServletRequest object, providing access to the HTTP request header information - extends the standard HttpServletRequest - and provides access to Sling-specific things like resource, path info, selector, etc.
* **slingResponse**, SlingHttpServletResponse object, providing access for the HTTP response that is created by the server. This is currently the same as the HttpServletResponse from which it extends.
* **resourceResolver**, Current ResourceResolver. Same as slingRequest.getResourceResolver().
* **sling**, SlingScriptHelper, containing convenience methods for scripts, mainly sling.include('/some/other/resource') for including the responses of other resources inside this response (eg. embedding header html snippets) and sling.getService(foo.bar.Service.class) to retrieve OSGi services available in Sling (Class notation depending on scripting language).
* **resource**, current Resource to handle, depending on the URL of the request. Same as slingRequest.getResource().
* **log**, provides an SLF4J Logger for logging to the Sling log system from within scripts, eg. log.info("Executing my script").
* **currentNode**, the underlying JCR node (if there is one) of the current resource.
* **bindings**, provides access to the SlingBindings object for access to non-standard scripting variables.
