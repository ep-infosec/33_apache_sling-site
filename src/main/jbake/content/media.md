This page holds all media required for the Apache Sling website. The media are attachments and can be addressed using the following URL: http://cwiki.apache.org/SLINGxSITE/media.data/ (followed by the actual name of the attachment).

Currently, some of these attachments are used by the overall site template (only visible/editable by Confluence administrators).
