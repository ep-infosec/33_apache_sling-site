This table lists properties which have known functionality in the OSGi and Sling frameworks.

With the exception of the Sling setup properties (`sling.home`, `sling.launchpad`, and `sling.properties`) all properties can be set on the command line using the `-D` command line option or in the `sling.properties` file. Properties defined on the command line or in the `web.xml` file always overwrite properties in the `sling.properties` file.

## Logging Configuration

Logging configuration defined by these properties sets up initial configuration for the Sling Commons Log bundle. This configuration is used as long as there is no configuration from the Configuration Admin Service for the service PID `org.apache.sling.commons.log.LogManager`.

| `org.apache.sling.commons.log.file` | `${sling.home}/logs/error.log` | Sets the log file to which log messages are written. If this property is empty or missing, log messages are written to System.out. This property can also be set with the `-f` command line option. |
| `org.apache.sling.commons.log.file.number` | `5` | The number of rotated files to keep. |
| `org.apache.sling.commons.log.file.size` | `'.'yyyy-MM-dd` | Defines how the log file is rotated (by schedule or by size) and when to rotate. See the section [Log File Rotation](http://sling.apache.org/site/logging.html#Logging-LogFileRotation) for full details on log file rotation. |
