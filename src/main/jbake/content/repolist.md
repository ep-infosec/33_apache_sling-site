~~~~~~

This is the list of all Sling source code repositories, generated by a script found in 
the [sling-aggregator](https://github.com/apache/sling-aggregator) project, where
you can also find instructions on how to checkout all repositories using the
`repo` tool.

The colored balls indicate the build status using the Jenkins conventions: blue is
a stable build, orange is unstable, red means failure and grey indicates a disabled build.

As I write this, many builds are unstable due to [SLING-10691](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SLING-10691),
the Sonar analysis failing with Java 11 for older modules.

If you're unsure about the status of one of these repositories please ask on our dev list.

All repositories have names which start with `sling-` so you can also list them
with a [GitHub query](https://github.com/apache/?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=sling).

We also have specific documentation about some of these modules on the
[Bundles](documentation/bundles.html) page.
