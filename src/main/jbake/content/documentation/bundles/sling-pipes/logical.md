Those pipes help assembling pipes, or modifying the resource streams 
[readers](/documentation/bundles/sling-pipes/readers.html) or [writers](/documentation/bundles/sling-pipes/writers.html)
could create.

### FilterPipe (`grep(conf)`)
outputs the input resource if its matches its configuration

    echo /content/foo | grep foo=bar integerProp=2 booleanOne=false
    
will outputs `/content/foo` only if it has properties specified, you can revert the logic with Ì€ slingPipesFilter_not` set to true

    echo /content/foo | grep foo=bar @ with slingPipesFilter_not=true

will either return `/content/foo` either nothing depending on it not containing `@foo=bar`

you can do more complex use case tackling direclty the "compiled" persistence of the pipe 

- `sling:resourceType` is `slingPipes/filter`
- `conf` node tree that will be tested against the current input of the pipe, each `/conf/sub@prop=value` will triggers a test
on `./sub@prop` property of the current input, testing if its value matches `value` regex. If the special `slingPipesFilter_noChildren=${true}`
property is there with the value instantiated as a true boolean, then filter will pass if corresponding node has no children.
- `slingPipesFilter_test='${...}'` evaluates the property value, and filters out the stream if the expression is not a boolean or false
- `slingPipesFilter_not='true'` inverts the expected result of the filter

### Super pipes
Pipes that litterally contains sub pipes, each super pipe share bindings with each others so data can be passed from one to another

#### ReferencePipe (`ref <path>`)
executes the pipe whose persistence is referenced in path property

        ref /conf/pipes/aPipePersistence

will execute the pipe `/conf/myPipes/aPipePersistence` 
if you add `/conf/myPipes` to plumberImpl `referencePaths` configuration, you can then execute

        ref aPipePersistence

### NotPipe
executes the pipe referenced in path property, passes input only if referenced pipe doesn't return any resource

- `sling:resourceType` is `slingPipes/not`
- `path` path of the referenced pipe

        not /conf/pipes/aPipePersistence
        
or as for referenced pipe:

        not aPipePersistence

#### Manifold
allows parallel execution of the sub pipes listed in configuration

- `sling:resourceType` is `slingPipes/manifold`
- `conf` node contains child pipes' configurations, that will be configured in the order they are found (note you should use sling:OrderedFolder)
- `queueSize` size of the merged resource queue, default is 10000
- `numThread` thread pool size for the execution of the subpipes, default is 5 - resource output will be ordered randomly;
   setting it to 1 will guarantee serial execution with predictable output order (i.e. the first subpipe resources will be exhausted before the second subpipe resources are output etc.);
   setting numThreads to 1 will have similar effects to using a container pipe, with the notable exception of output termination: 
   whereas a container pipe chains sub pipes and will stop when any subpipe produces no output, the manifold pipe handles subpipes as independent streams and combines their output regardless of any void subpipe output
- `executionTimeout` execution time out for each sub pipe; given in seconds; default is 24h

#### Container Pipe
assemble a simple sequence of pipes

- `sling:resourceType` is `slingPipes/container`
- `conf` node contains child pipes' configurations, that will be configured in the order they are found (note you should use sling:OrderedFolder)

Note that pipe builder api automatically creates one for you to chain the subpipe you are configuring.
