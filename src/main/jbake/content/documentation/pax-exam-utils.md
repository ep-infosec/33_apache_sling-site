Utilities to help testing Sling components with Pax Exam are available at
[https://github.com/apache/sling-org-apache-sling-paxexam-util](https://github.com/apache/sling-org-apache-sling-paxexam-util)

The focus is on making it easier to test Sling components against a full Sling launchpad,
with minimal boilerplate code.

See the
[SlingRepositoryTest](https://github.com/apache/sling-org-apache-sling-paxexam-util/blob/master/src/test/java/org/apache/sling/paxexam/util/SlingRepositoryTest.java) class
for an example test.
